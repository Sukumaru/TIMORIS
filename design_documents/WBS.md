# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for TIMORIS

## 1. First Basic Output: Tubule-Like Structure Detection

### 1.1 Goal
The first basic output of TIMORIS will be the identification of tubule-like structures from spatial transcriptomics data. This involves detecting spatial patterns based on gene expression and spatial coordinates.

### 1.2 Steps to Compute Output
#### 1.2.1 Data Preparation
- **Identify dataset**: Select a small-scale spatial transcriptomics dataset for initial testing.
- **Format verification**: Ensure the dataset is in `.h5ad` format.
- **Data preprocessing**:
  - Normalize gene expression values.
  - Filter low-quality or low-expression cells.
  - Extract spatial coordinates of each cell.

#### 1.2.2 Feature Extraction
- **Identify key marker genes**:
  - Use known tubule marker genes (if available) or perform gene selection based on clustering.
- **Compute spatial statistics**:
  - Calculate neighborhood density and nearest-neighbor distances.
  - Apply spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., Moranâ€™s I) to detect local structure.

#### 1.2.3 Structure Detection
- **Apply clustering algorithms**:
  - Use DBSCAN, k-means, or graph-based clustering to detect spatially structured regions.
- **Shape analysis**:
  - Compute elongation and curvature metrics to determine tubule-like morphology.
- **Validate detected structures**:
  - Compare detected clusters with known tubule locations (if annotated data is available).
  - Compute performance metrics such as precision and recall.

#### 1.2.4 Output Generation
- **Generate visualization**:
  - Overlay detected tubules on spatial plots.
  - Color-code clusters based on spatial properties.
- **Export results**:
  - Annotated `.h5ad` file with tubule labels.
