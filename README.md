# TIMORIS
**Tubule Identification and Mapping for Optimized Recognition in Spatial transcriptomics**
## Inspiration

Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized the ability to study gene expression in the spatial context of tissues, uncovering structural and functional relationships. However, detecting complex tissue architectures, such as tubule-like structures, remains a challenge. TIMORIS was developed to address this gap by combining computational power with biological insights, allowing researchers to better analyze and interpret spatial transcriptomics data.

This tool is particularly inspired by:

The need to detect and characterize specialized tissue structures in kidney, liver, and other organ systems where tubules play a crucial role.

The advancements in spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies that provide unprecedented resolution but lack standardized tools for spatial pattern detection.

The growing interest in integrating machine learning and statistical modeling with biological data to reveal new insights into tissue organization and disease mechanisms.

## Description

This repository contains a tool developed as part of the BIOINF 576 course to detect tubule-like structures in tissue using spatial transcriptomics data, preferably at single-cell resolution. The tool integrates spatial pattern detection algorithms and transcriptomics data analysis to identify and characterize tubule-like formations within tissue samples.


## Getting Started
## Features
- Spatial Pattern Detection: Leverages advanced spatial statistics and machine learning techniques to detect elongated tubule-like structures.

- Single-Cell Resolution: Optimized for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data, ensuring that fine-grained details of tubule-like structures are preserved and accurately detected.

- Customizable Workflows: Modular design to allow integration of different datasets and preprocessing methods.

- Visualization: Provides intuitive visual outputs to overlay detected structures on tissue images and expression maps.
