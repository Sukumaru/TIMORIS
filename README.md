# TIMORIS
**Tubule Identification and Mapping for Optimized Recognition in Spatial transcriptomics**
## Inspiration

Spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized the ability to study gene expression in the spatial context of tissues, uncovering structural and functional relationships. However, detecting complex tissue architectures, such as tubule-like structures, remains a challenge. TIMORIS was developed to address this gap by combining computational power with biological insights, allowing researchers to better analyze and interpret spatial transcriptomics data.


The need to detect and characterize specialized tissue structures in kidney, liver, germ and other organ systems where tubules play a crucial role.

The advancements in spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies that provide unprecedented resolution but lack standardized tools for spatial pattern detection.

The growing interest in integrating machine learning and statistical modeling with biological data to reveal new insights into tissue organization and disease mechanisms.

### Understanding Tubule Structures

Tubules are **elongated, tube-like anatomical structures** found in various biological systems. They play critical roles in **filtration, secretion, absorption, and transport** within tissues.
