# TIMORIS
**Tubule Identification and Mapping for Optimized Recognition in Spatial transcriptomics**

## Description

This repository contains a tool developed as part of the BIOINF 576 course to detect tubule-like structures in tissue using spatial transcriptomics data, preferably at single-cell resolution. The tool integrates spatial pattern detection algorithms and transcriptomics data analysis to identify and characterize tubule-like formations within tissue samples.


## Getting Started
## Features
- Spatial Pattern Detection: Leverages advanced spatial statistics and machine learning techniques to detect elongated tubule-like structures.

- Customizable Workflows: Modular design to allow integration of different datasets and preprocessing methods.

- Visualization: Provides intuitive visual outputs to overlay detected structures on tissue images and expression maps.
